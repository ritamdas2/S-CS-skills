  Used 3.3V from the ESP32 and plugged ESP32 into an USB power source
  the ESP32 board will source up to ~250mA of the total of 500mA at 3.3V)
  Used resistors so that I <= max current mA (I=V/R), V is your source voltage (use 330 ohm)
-Drive a blink-type program to count up, and wrap, in binary on the set of 4 LEDs
