# Skill 26: Databases (Team Skill)

## Summary

We used levelDB in order to create a database that stores sample text data that we can query from. After installing the required tools (npm install level, and line reader), we set a 2000 millisecond delay to prevent a "promise pending" error. Afterwards, we were able to display to console log a sample query by using db.get and having an error function.

The query should successfully return the Time, ID, Smoke, and Temp.
