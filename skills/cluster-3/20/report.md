### Skill 20 - DYNDNS for Pi (TEAM SKILL)

##### Ritam Das (Raghurama Bukkarayasamudram, Brian Macomber)

To complete this skill, I created a free account on No-IP and created a hostname that connected to my router's public IP. I downloaded the desktop client to constantly update the IP. From here, using the application connected to my router, I created a port forward for my Laptop's local IP at the internal port 8080 and external port 1131. While it's running, the hello world script can be viewed at http://team3ec444.ddns.net:1131
