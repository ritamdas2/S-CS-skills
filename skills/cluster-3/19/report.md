## Summary
- Enabled “Ethernet Gadget” mode for the pi connected to your laptop/desktop computer

- Enabled “connection sharing” to allow the pi to access the Internet through your computer

- Configured the pi as a Wireless Access Point

I was able to set up the access point successfully as it showed up under wifi networks. However, there was no internet as webpages failed to load. (Set up on macOS)
Moved on to next skill
